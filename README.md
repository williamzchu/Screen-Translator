# Screen Translator

An android app that allows a user to take a photo that contains a language and translates that language to English or any other language and overlays it on top of the original text.
A possible use could be taking a picture of a manga book and having the English translation appear on top of the Japanese text, allowing the use to read the manga book in English.
Currently in progress..

Developed by William Chu, Richard Yuan, and Brian Fu.
